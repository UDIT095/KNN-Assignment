# üêæ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Animal Classification

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to **classify animals** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm based on their physical attributes. The project includes **data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation**, and **visualization** of decision boundaries.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **Zoo Dataset** (`Zoo.csv`), which contains animal characteristics and their corresponding type classifications.

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis and Visualization

- Load and inspect dataset using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Count plots and correlation matrices to explore data distribution and relationships

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

- Drop `animal name` as it's not relevant for classification
- No missing values found; dataset is clean
- Scale numeric and binary features using **StandardScaler**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement KNN Classifier

- Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
- Initialize and train the `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Use **Elbow Method** to determine optimal K value
- Apply cross-validation to ensure model generalization

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using:
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**
- üìä **Precision**
- üéØ **Recall**
- üìà **F1 Score**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization

- Use **PCA** to reduce dimensions to 2D
- Plot **decision boundaries** to show class separability
